1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server side routing is the 'older' way of processing new data on a webpage. Anytime new data would be needed, no matter how small, the entire webpage would have to be reloaded and refreshed from the server. But, it only loads 1 page at a time so it could run faster initially.

Client side routing loads all of the information all at once so overall, the experiance is more pleasureable to the user. New pages are already saved so when going to a new page, it's able to be loaded more quickly.
